Hi, glad to see you! I am Yiming, a PhD Student at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by [Prof. Hongxia Yang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/people/academic-staff/prof-yang-hongxia/).

My research interests focus on efficient LLMs. We aim to lower the barriers to LLM training, making it more accessible and enabling a broader range of institutions to participate in the development and application of LLMs. Specifically, I am committed to advancing ultra-low-bit QAT (below 2 bits), low-bit pre-training (e.g., FP8), and ultra-low-bit PTQ. In addition, I also work on model fusion, which aims to construct stronger LLMs by leveraging and combining existing models.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Engineering Mechanics from Harbin Institute of Technology, supervised by [Prof. Yubao Zhen](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/zhenyb?lang=zh). After that, I studied Computational Science and Engineering at Technische Universität München and graduated with merit. During my master's studies, I worked closely with [Prof. David Wozabal](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/wozabal-david) and [Dr. Wolfgang Ridinger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wolfgang-ridinger-37845b55/?locale=en_US).
