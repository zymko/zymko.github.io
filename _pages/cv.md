Work experience
======
* **Research Assistant | Moder Merging** (10.2024-05.2025)

  Supervisor: Prof. Hongxia Yang, Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong
<!-- * Led the team to develop a resource-efficient framework for merging domain-specific LLMs to enhance reasoning abilities. The framework supports merging models of both similar and different architectures using layer-wise weight 
strategies and probabilistic knowledge from fine-tuning data. This work demonstrated that merging expert models 
improves reasoning capabilities, offering an efficient, decentralized alternative to traditional centralized LLMs. -->

* **Development Engineer | Data Closed-loop** (08.2023-08.2024)

  R & D Department, iMotion Automotive GmbH, Germany 
<!-- * Developed automated pre-processing pipelines for data processing, including image separation, pre-recognition, and 
storage. Built a YOLO-based anonymization model to remove personal information, such as license plates and faces, 
ensuring GDPR compliance. Optimized algorithm performance through multi-processing and asynchronous GPU and 
CPU resource management, and successfully deployed the model on the cloud.  -->

* **Data Scientisit Intern | Continuous Intraday Market Forecasting and Optimizing** (05.2022-06.2023)
  Supervisor: Prof. David Wozabal, Dr. Wolfgang Ridlinger, Data Science Department, Entrix, Germany
<!-- * Developed predictive models to forecast average electricity prices one hour before delivery in the continuous intraday market. Compared various approaches such as time-varying regression, LSTM, MLP, and proposed a Hierarchical 
Linear Model to address missing data. Integrated forecasts into rolling intrinsic algorithms, enabling the optimizer to 
leverage future price insights for smarter decision-making.  -->
